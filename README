# Coffee Friends

Coffee Friends teams up with local coffee shops to easily send gifts of coffee to your friends. You can browse by borough and neighborhood to find the most conveniently located store, receive texts when a friend has sent you a gift, see lists of all given and received gifts, and view your redemption vouchers. Coffee shops can see lists of all the gifts associated with their store, as well as search through redemption codes at the time of sale. Coffee friends also allows you to send an anonymous, charitable gift of coffee to someone who needs it!

### Possible Next Steps

- Set up partnerships with local coffee shops
- Expand beyond NYC
- Allow cafes to update menu items and edit profile
- Integrate cafe POS systems

### Development Team

Coffee Friends was originall built in 2015 as the capstone project for the [Dev Bootcamp](https://devbootcamp.com) program. The project was completed in under one week and was designed to showcase the skills and abilities acquired in the program.

## Coffee Friends v2

This version of the application is my (Kelly's) attempt to recreate the original using the latest versions of Ruby and Rails. ðŸ¤ž

### Local Development

Instructions for macOS.

#### Install Dependencies

```Bash
brew install rbenv ruby-build
cat .ruby-version | rbenv install
eval "$(rbenv init -)"
```

```Bash
export GEM_HOME=$(ruby -e 'puts Gem.user_dir')
export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$HOME/.rbenv/shims:$GEM_HOME/bin:$PATH"
echo "-v '~> $(cat .ruby-version)'" | sudo gem install bundler
bundle install
```

#### Build Application

```Bash
rails -v
rails new .
bin/rails generate controller Cafes index --skip-routes
```

#### Linting

(MacOS only) Create a file at `/etc/paths.d/<your-username>`. Add a single line that consists of `$GEM_HOME/bin` (the actual path, not the variable). This will help VSCode find `rufo`.

#### Start Development Server

```Bash
bundle install
bin/rails server
```
